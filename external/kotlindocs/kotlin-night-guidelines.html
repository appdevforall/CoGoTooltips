       Kotlin Night should be a free event. A minimal fee can be charged to cover expenses, but it should remain a non-profit event.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li class="list__item" id="-z7d6bf_12">
      <p>
       The event should be announced publicly and open for all people to attend without any kind of discrimination.

     <li class="list__item" id="-z7d6bf_13">
      <p>
       If you publish the contents of the talks online after the event, they must be free and accessible to everyone, without any sign-up or registration procedures.

       Recordings are optional but recommended, and they should also be made available. If you decide to record the talks, we suggest having a plan to ensure the quality is good.

     <li class="list__item" id="-z7d6bf_15">
      <p>
       The talks should primarily be about Kotlin and should not focus on marketing or sales.
