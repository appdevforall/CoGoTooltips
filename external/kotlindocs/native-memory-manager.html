    Kotlin/Native memory management

    Kotlin/Native uses a modern memory manager that is similar to the JVM, Go, and other mainstream technologies, including the following features:

   <ul class="list _bullet" id="z9tdp9u_3">
    <li class="list__item" id="z9tdp9u_8">
     <p>

     </p>
    </li>
    <li class="list__item" id="z9tdp9u_9">
     <p>
      Tracing garbage collection is performed periodically to collect objects that are not reachable from the "roots", like local and global variables.

     Kotlin/Native's garbage collector (GC) algorithm is constantly evolving. Currently, it functions as a stop-the-world mark and concurrent sweep collector that does not separate the heap into generations.
    </p>
    <p id="z9tdp9u_11">
     The GC is executed on a separate thread and started based on the memory pressure heuristics or by a timer. Alternatively, it can be

     .
    </p>
    <p id="z9tdp9u_12">
     The GC processes the mark queue on several threads in parallel, including application threads, the GC thread, and optional marker threads. Application threads and at least one GC thread participate in the marking process. By default, application threads must be paused when the GC is marking objects in the heap.

    </aside>
    <p id="z9tdp9u_14">
     When the marking phase is completed, the GC processes weak references and nullifies reference points to an unmarked object. By default, weak references are processed concurrently to decrease the GC pause time.

      memory allocator
     </a>
     . It divides system memory into pages, allowing independent sweeping in consecutive order. Each allocation becomes a memory block within a page, and the page keeps track of block sizes. Different page types are optimized for various allocation sizes. The consecutive arrangement of memory blocks ensures efficient iteration through all allocated blocks.
    </p>
    <p id="z9tdp9u_67">
     When a thread allocates memory, it searches for a suitable page based on the allocation size. Threads maintain a set of pages for different size categories. Typically, the current page for a given size can accommodate the allocation. If not, the thread requests a different page from the shared allocation space. This page may already be available, require sweeping, or have to be created first.
    </p>
    <p id="z9tdp9u_68">
     The Kotlin/Native memory allocator comes with protection against sudden spikes in memory allocations. It prevents situations where the mutator starts to allocate a lot of garbage quickly and the GC thread cannot keep up with it, making the memory usage grow endlessly. In this case, the GC forces a stop-the-world phase until the iteration is completed.
