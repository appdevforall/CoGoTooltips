          The Joy of Kotlin
         </a>
         teaches you the right way to code in Kotlin.
        </p>
        <p id="il91q7_53">
         In this insight-rich book, you'll master the Kotlin language while exploring coding techniques that will make you a better developer no matter what language you use. Kotlin natively supports a functional style of programming, so seasoned author Pierre-Yves Saumont begins by reviewing the FP principles of immutability, referential transparency, and the separation between functions and effects.
        </p>
        <p id="il91q7_54">
         Then, you'll move deeper into using Kotlin in the real world, as you learn to handle errors and data properly, encapsulate shared state mutations, and work with laziness.
        </p>
        <p id="il91q7_55">
         This book will change the way you code â€” and give you back some of the joy you had when you first started.
