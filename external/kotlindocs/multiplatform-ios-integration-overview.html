    iOS integration methods

   <p id="tfzju6_2">
    You can integrate a Kotlin Multiplatform shared module into your iOS app. For that, you generate an
    <a data-external="true" href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/WhatAreFrameworks.html" id="tfzju6_8" rel="noopener noreferrer">
     iOS framework
    </a>
    from the shared module and then add it as a dependency to the iOS project:

   </figure>
   <p id="tfzju6_4">
    It's possible to consume this framework as a local or remote dependency. Choose local integration if you want to have full control over the entire codebase and get instant updates to final applications when the common code changes.
   </p>
   <p id="tfzju6_5">
    If you want to explicitly separate the code base of your final application from the common code base, set up remote integration. In this case, the shared code will be integrated into final applications like a regular third-party dependency.

    <p id="tfzju6_9">
     In a local setup, there are two main integration options. You can use direct integration through a special script, which makes the Kotlin build a part of the iOS build. If you have Pod dependencies in your Kotlin Multiplatform project, take the CocoaPods integration approach.

      You can connect the iOS framework directly from the Kotlin Multiplatform project by adding a special script to your Xcode project. The script is integrated into the build phase of your project's build settings.
