    Kotlin for data analysis
   </h1>
   <p id="qngue2_2">
    Exploring and analyzing data is something you may not do every day, but it's a crucial skill you need as a software developer.
   </p>
   <p id="qngue2_3">
    Let's think about software development duties where data analysis is key: analyzing what's actually inside collections when debugging, digging into memory dumps or databases, or receiving JSON files with large amounts of data when working with REST APIs, to mention some.
   </p>
   <p id="qngue2_4">
    With Kotlin's Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tools, such as
