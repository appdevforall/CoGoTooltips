    Kotlin and continuous integration with TeamCity

     TeamCity

    Kotlin works with different build tools, so if you're using a standard tool such as Ant, Maven or Gradle, the process for setting up a Kotlin project is no different to any other language or library that integrates with these tools. Where there are some minor requirements and differences is when using the internal build system of IntelliJ IDEA, which is also supported on TeamCity.

     Gradle, Maven, and Ant

    <p id="-vk2v3_9">
     If using Ant, Maven or Gradle, the setup process is straightforward. All that is needed is to define the Build Step. For example, if using Gradle, simply define the required parameters such as the Step Name and Gradle tasks that need executing for the Runner Type.

    <p id="-vk2v3_11">
     Since all the dependencies required for Kotlin are defined in the Gradle file, nothing else needs to be configured specifically for Kotlin to run correctly.
    </p>
    <p id="-vk2v3_12">
     If using Ant or Maven, the same configuration applies. The only difference being that the Runner Type would be Ant or Maven respectively.

     IntelliJ IDEA Build System
    </h2>
    <p id="-vk2v3_13">
     If using IntelliJ IDEA build system with TeamCity, make sure that the version of Kotlin being used by IntelliJ IDEA is the same as the one that TeamCity runs. You may need to download the specific version of the Kotlin plugin and install it on TeamCity.
    </p>
    <p id="-vk2v3_14">
     Fortunately, there is a meta-runner already available that takes care of most of the manual work. If not familiar with the concept of TeamCity meta-runners, check the
     <a data-external="true" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/teamcity/working-with-meta-runner.html" id="-vk2v3_18" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      documentation
     </a>
     . They are very easy and powerful way to introduce custom Runners without the need to write plugins.

      The meta-runner for Kotlin is available on

      . Download that meta-runner and import it from the TeamCity user interface

      Setup Kotlin compiler fetching step

      Basically this step is limited to defining the Step Name and the version of Kotlin you need. Tags can be used.

      The runner will set the value for the property
      <code class="code" id="-vk2v3_25">
       system.path.macro.KOTLIN.BUNDLED
      </code>
      to the correct one based on the path settings from the IntelliJ IDEA project. However, this value needs to be defined in TeamCity (and can be set to any value). Therefore, you need to define it as a system variable.

      The final step is to define the actual compilation of the project, which uses the standard IntelliJ IDEA Runner Type.

      With that, our project should now build and produce the corresponding artifacts.

     If using a continuous integration tool different to TeamCity, as long as it supports any of the build tools, or calling command line tools, compiling Kotlin and automating things as part of a CI process should be possible.
