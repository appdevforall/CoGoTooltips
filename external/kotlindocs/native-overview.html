    Kotlin/Native is a technology for compiling Kotlin code to native binaries which can run without a virtual machine. Kotlin/Native includes an

     Why Kotlin/Native?
    </h2>
    <p id="pbo9wa_9">
     Kotlin/Native is primarily designed to allow compilation for platforms on which
     <span class="emphasis" id="pbo9wa_10">
      virtual machines
     </span>
     are not desirable or possible, such as embedded devices or iOS. It is ideal for situations when a developer needs to produce a self-contained program that does not require an additional runtime or virtual machine.
