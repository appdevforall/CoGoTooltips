     Why is KSP faster than kapt?
    </h2>
    <p id="-4f2v7s_18">
     kapt has to parse and resolve every type reference in order to generate Java stubs, whereas KSP resolves references on-demand. Delegating to javac also takes time.
    </p>
    <p id="-4f2v7s_19">
     Additionally, KSP's
     <a data-tooltip="Incremental processing is a processing technique that avoids re-processing of sources as much as possible. The primary goal of incremental processing is to reduce the turn-around time of a typical change-compile-test cycle. For general information, see Wikipedia's article onâ€¦" href="ksp-incremental.html" id="-4f2v7s_20">
      incremental processing model
     </a>
     has a finer granularity than just isolating and aggregating. It finds more opportunities to avoid reprocessing everything. Also, because KSP traces symbol resolutions dynamically, a change in a file is less likely to pollute other files and therefore the set of files to be reprocessed is smaller. This is not possible for kapt because it delegates processing to javac.

     Is KSP Kotlin-specific?
    </h2>
    <p id="-4f2v7s_21">
     KSP can process Java sources as well. The API is unified, meaning that when you parse a Java class and a Kotlin class you get a unified data structure in KSP.

     How to upgrade KSP?
    </h2>
    <p id="-4f2v7s_22">
     KSP has API and implementation. The API rarely changes and is backward compatible: there can be new interfaces, but old interfaces never change. The implementation is tied to a specific compiler version. With the new release, the supported compiler version can change.
    </p>
    <p id="-4f2v7s_23">
     Processors only depend on API and therefore are not tied to compiler versions. However, users of processors need to bump KSP version when bumping the compiler version in their project. Otherwise, the following error will occur:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block" data-lang="none">
     ksp-a.b.c is too old for kotlin-x.y.z. Please upgrade ksp or downgrade kotlin-gradle-plugin
    </div>
    <aside class="prompt" data-title="" data-type="note" id="-4f2v7s_25">
     <p id="-4f2v7s_27">
      Users of processors don't need to bump processor's version because processors only depend on API.
     </p>
    </aside>
    <p id="-4f2v7s_26">
     For example, some processor is released and tested with KSP 1.0.1, which depends strictly on Kotlin 1.6.0. To make it work with Kotlin 1.6.20, the only thing you need to do is bump KSP to a version (for example, KSP 1.1.0) that is built for Kotlin 1.6.20.

     Can I use a newer KSP implementation with an older Kotlin compiler?
    </h2>
    <p id="-4f2v7s_28">
     If the language version is the same, Kotlin compiler is supposed to be backward compatible. Bumping Kotlin compiler should be trivial most of the time. If you need a newer KSP implementation, please upgrade the Kotlin compiler accordingly.
