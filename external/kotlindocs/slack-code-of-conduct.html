    Code of conduct and guidelines for Kotlin Slack
   </h1>
   <p id="z8100ns_2">
    Kotlin Slack aims to be an inclusive space committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).
   </p>
   <p id="z8100ns_3">
    For this to be the case, it is vital that we all follow a basic set of guidelines and most importantly, adhere to the code of conduct. As such, please make sure you read this Code of Conduct and Basic Usage Guidelines in its entirety. This isn't your regular License Agreement that you should scroll through and agree blindly. It's here for a reason and also contains practical information.

     There are over 50 000 users on many different timezones using the Kotlin Slack, and the number is growing rapidly.

     <li class="list__item" id="z8100ns_52">
      <p>
       New channels should be focused around a well-known technology or area of interest. Create them sparingly. And before requesting for a new channel, make sure it doesn't exist in any other shape or form. Ask an administrator to create a new channel on the #meta channel. If you do end up creating a channel, make sure you set the topic.

       Please do not ping or mention someone directly to get your questions answered, especially project owners, whether the project is Kotlin or other, unless they specifically indicate that you can.

     <li class="list__item" id="z8100ns_57">
      <p>
       Use code blocks. Don't paste code as plain text. Slack supports Kotlin markup. If the code you are pasting is longer than a few lines, use "Code or text snippet" available from

      <p>
       While it's polite to say "Hi" or "I have a question" before asking something, it doesn't scale and leads to noise. You can say hello in the same message you ask the question if you like.

     <li class="list__item" id="z8100ns_59">

       Using threads is not required, but do take into account that it does allow people to more easily follow conversations, especially those jumping in late.

     <li class="list__item" id="z8100ns_60">
      <p>
       Use reactions to show gratitude as opposed to a message. It reduces the noise and gets the message across.

     </li>
     <li class="list__item" id="z8100ns_61">
      <p>
       Don't use reactions to tell people they're in the wrong place or asking the wrong question. If they're on the wrong channel, point them to the right one. If their question is badly worded, help them correct it. Have empathy.

       Take into account cultural differences. As they say, what the British say isn't what the British mean. Remember this both as the receiver and producer of messages.

       Don't create integrations with Slack. Given this is running on the free tier, the number is limited, and thus it won't be approved.
