    A Kotlin User Group, or KUG, is a community that is dedicated to Kotlin and that offers you a place to share your Kotlin programming experience with like-minded people.
   </p>
   <p id="q62e5q_3">
    To become a KUG, your community should have some specific features shared by every KUG. It should:
   </p>
   <ul class="list _bullet" id="q62e5q_4">
    <li class="list__item" id="q62e5q_10">
     <p>
      Provide Kotlin-related content, with regular meetups as the main form of activity.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li class="list__item" id="q62e5q_11">
     <p>
      Host regular events (at least once every 3 months) with open registration and without any restriction for attendance.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li class="list__item" id="q62e5q_12">
     <p>
      Be driven and organized by the community, and it should not use events to earn money or gain any other business benefits from members and attendees.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li class="list__item" id="q62e5q_13">
     <p>
      Follow and ensure a code of conduct to provide a welcoming environment for attendees of any background and experience (check out our recommended

      ).
     </p>
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p id="q62e5q_5">
    There are no limits regarding the format for KUG meetups. They can take place in whatever fashion works best for the community, whether that includes presentations, hands-on labs, lectures, hackathons, or informal beer-driven get-togethers.
