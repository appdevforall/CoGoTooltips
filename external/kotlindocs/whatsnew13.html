     Contracts
    </h2>
    <p id="pdx5ce_39">
     The Kotlin compiler does extensive static analysis to provide warnings and reduce boilerplate. One of the most notable features is smartcasts — with the ability to perform a cast automatically based on the performed type checks:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block" data-lang="kotlin">
     fun foo(s: String?) {
    if (s != null) s.length // Compiler automatically casts 's' to 'String'
}
    </div>
    <p id="pdx5ce_41">
     However, as soon as these checks are extracted in a separate function, all the smartcasts immediately disappear:
    </p>
    <div class="code-block" data-lang="kotlin">
     fun String?.isNotNull(): Boolean = this != null

fun foo(s: String?) {
    if (s.isNotNull()) s.length // No smartcast :(
}
    </div>
    <p id="pdx5ce_43">
     To improve the behavior in such cases, Kotlin 1.3 introduces experimental mechanism called
     <span class="emphasis" id="pdx5ce_51">

     Kotlin cares a lot about stability and backward compatibility of code: Kotlin compatibility policy says that breaking changes (e.g., a change which makes the code that used to compile fine, not compile anymore) can be introduced only in the major releases (
     <span class="control" id="pdx5ce_105">
      1.2

     ,

     We believe that a lot of users could use a much faster cycle where critical compiler bug fixes arrive immediately, making the code more safe and correct. So, Kotlin 1.3 introduces the
     <span class="emphasis" id="pdx5ce_107">
      progressive
     </span>
     compiler mode, which can be enabled by passing the argument
     <code class="code" id="pdx5ce_108">
      -progressive
     </code>
     to the compiler.
    </p>
    <p id="pdx5ce_102">
     In the progressive mode, some fixes in language semantics can arrive immediately. All these fixes have two important properties:

     <li class="list__item" id="pdx5ce_109">
      <p>
       They preserve backward compatibility of source code with older compilers, meaning that all the code which is compilable by the progressive compiler will be compiled fine by non-progressive one.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li class="list__item" id="pdx5ce_110">
      <p>
       They only make code
       <span class="emphasis" id="pdx5ce_111">
        safer

       in some sense — e.g., some unsound smartcast can be forbidden, behavior of the generated code may be changed to be more predictable/stable, and so on.
      </p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p id="pdx5ce_104">
     Enabling the progressive mode can require you to rewrite some of your code, but it shouldn't be too much — all the fixes enabled under progressive are carefully handpicked, reviewed, and provided with tooling migration assistance. We expect that the progressive mode will be a nice choice for any actively maintained codebases which are updated to the latest language versions quickly.
