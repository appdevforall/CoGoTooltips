    K2 compiler migration guide
   </h1>
   <p id="-ynlooc_2">
    As the Kotlin language and ecosystem have continued to evolve, so has the Kotlin compiler. The first step was the introduction of the new JVM and JS IR (Intermediate Representation) backends that share logic, simplifying code generation for targets on different platforms. Now, the next stage of its evolution brings a new frontend known as K2.

   <p id="-ynlooc_4">
    With the arrival of the K2 compiler, the Kotlin frontend has been completely rewritten and features a new, more efficient architecture. The fundamental change the new compiler brings is the use of one unified data structure that contains more semantic information. This frontend is responsible for performing semantic analysis, call resolution, and type inference.
   </p>
   <p id="-ynlooc_5">
    The new architecture and enriched data structure enables the K2 compiler to provide the following benefits:

     To evaluate the performance of the K2 compiler, we ran performance tests on two open-source projects:

    </p>
    <ul class="list _bullet" id="-ynlooc_43">
     <li class="list__item" id="-ynlooc_47">
      <p>
       The K2 compiler brings up to 94% compilation speed gains. For example, in the Anki-Android project, clean build times were reduced from 57.7 seconds in Kotlin 1.9.23 to 29.7 seconds in Kotlin 2.0.0.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li class="list__item" id="-ynlooc_48">
      <p>
       The initialization phase is up to 488% faster with the K2 compiler. For example, in the Anki-Android project, the initialization phase for incremental builds was cut from 0.126 seconds in Kotlin 1.9.23 to just 0.022 seconds in Kotlin 2.0.0.
      </p>
     </li>
     <li class="list__item" id="-ynlooc_49">
      <p>
       The Kotlin K2 compiler is up to 376% quicker in the analysis phase compared to the previous compiler. For example, in the Anki-Android project, analysis times for incremental builds were slashed from 0.581 seconds in Kotlin 1.9.23 to only 0.122 seconds in Kotlin 2.0.0.

      <p id="-ynlooc_117">
       In Kotlin 2.0.0, we've made improvements to exception handling so that smart cast information can be passed on to

       <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_120">

       blocks. This change makes your code safer as the compiler keeps track of whether your object has a nullable type. For example:

        println(stringInput.length)
        // 0

        // The compiler rejects previous smart cast information for

        stringInput = null

        stringInput = ""

        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler knows stringInput 
        // can be null, so stringInput stays nullable.
        println(stringInput?.length)
        // null

       Prior to Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler didn't understand that the type of an object can change after using an increment or decrement operator. As the compiler couldn't accurately track the object type, your code could lead to unresolved reference errors. In Kotlin 2.0.0, this has been fixed:

fun main(input: Rho) {
    var unknownObject: Rho = input

    // Check if unknownObject inherits from the Tau interface
    // Note, it's possible that unknownObject inherits from both
    // Rho and Tau interfaces.
    if (unknownObject is Tau) {

        // Use the overloaded inc() operator from interface Rho.
        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the type of unknownObject is smart-cast to
        // Sigma.
        ++unknownObject

        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler knows unknownObject has type
        // Sigma, so the sigma() function can be called successfully.
        unknownObject.sigma()

        // In Kotlin 1.9.20, the compiler doesn't perform a smart cast
        // when inc() is called so the compiler still thinks that 
        // unknownObject has type Tau. Calling the sigma() function 
        // throws a compile-time error.
        
        // In Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler knows unknownObject has type

        unknownObject.tau()
        // Unresolved reference 'tau'

        // In Kotlin 1.9.20, since the compiler mistakenly thinks that

        We're still in the process of migrating to the new compilation scheme, so the resolution behavior is still the same when you call functions that aren't within the same source set. You'll notice this difference mainly when you use overloads from a multiplatform library in your common code.

        within the same source set, the function from the common code will be resolved because your code doesn't have access to the platform-specific version:

        module is in a separate source set, it also still has access to platform-specific code. Therefore, the resolution of calls to functions in the

        module exhibits the same behavior as in the old compilation scheme.

       What's changed?
      </span>
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_298">
      In Kotlin 2.0, all
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_308">
       open
      </code>
      properties with backing fields must be immediately initialized; otherwise, you'll get a compilation error. Previously, only
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_309">
       open var
      </code>
      properties needed to be initialized right away, but now this extends to
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_310">
       open val
      </code>
      properties with backing fields too:
     </p>
     <div class="code-block" data-lang="kotlin">
      open class Base {
    open val a: Int
    open var b: Int
    
    init {
        // Error starting with Kotlin 2.0 that earlier compiled successfully 
        this.a = 1 //Error: open val must have initializer
        // Always an error
        this.b = 1 // Error: open var must have initializer
    }
}

class Derived : Base() {
    override val a: Int = 2
    override var b = 2
}
     </div>
     <p id="-ynlooc_300">
      This change makes the compiler's behavior more predictable. Consider an example where an
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_311">
       open val
      </code>
      property is overridden by a
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_312">
       var
      </code>
      property with a custom setter.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_301">
      If a custom setter is used, deferred initialization can lead to confusion because it's unclear whether you want to initialize the backing field or to invoke the setter. In the past, if you wanted to invoke the setter, the old compiler couldn't guarantee that the setter would then initialize the backing field.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_302">
      <span class="control" id="-ynlooc_313">
       What's the best practice now?
      </span>
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_303">
      We encourage you to always initialize open properties with backing fields, as we believe this practice is both more efficient and less error-prone.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_304">
      However, if you don't want to immediately initialize a property, you can:
     </p>
     <ul class="list _bullet" id="-ynlooc_305">
      <li class="list__item" id="-ynlooc_314">
       <p>

        <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_316">
         final
        </code>
        .
       </p>
      </li>
      <li class="list__item" id="-ynlooc_315">
       <p>
        Use a private backing property that allows for deferred initialization.

      If you use the synthetic setter of a Java class to assign a type that conflicts with the class's projected type, an error is triggered.

      If you see that this change introduces errors in your code, you might wish to reconsider how you structure your type declarations. It could be that you don't need to use type projections, or perhaps you need to remove any assignments from your code.

      Forbidden use of inaccessible generic types
     </h3>

       What's changed?
      </span>
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_337">
      Due to the new architecture of our K2 compiler, we've changed how we handle inaccessible generic types. Generally, you should never rely on inaccessible generic types in your code because this indicates a misconfiguration in your project's build configuration, preventing the compiler from accessing the necessary information to compile. In Kotlin 2.0.0, you can't declare or call a function literal with an inaccessible generic type, nor use a generic type with inaccessible generic type arguments. This restriction helps you avoid compiler errors later in your code.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_338">
      For example, let's say that you declared a generic class in one module:
     </p>
     <div class="code-block" data-lang="kotlin">
      // Module one
class Node&lt;V&gt;(val value: V)
     </div>
     <p id="-ynlooc_340">
      If you have another module (module two) with a dependency configured on module one, your code can access the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_359">
       Node&lt;V&gt;
      </code>
      class and use it as a type in function types:
     </p>
     <div class="code-block" data-lang="kotlin">
      // Module two
fun execute(func: (Node&lt;Int&gt;) -&gt; Unit) {}
// Function compiles successfully
     </div>
     <p id="-ynlooc_342">
      However, if your project is misconfigured such that you have a third module (module three) that depends only on module two, the Kotlin compiler won't be able to access the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_360">
       Node&lt;V&gt;
      </code>
      class in
      <span class="control" id="-ynlooc_361">
       module one
      </span>
      when compiling the third module. Now, any lambdas or anonymous functions in module three that use the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_362">
       Node&lt;V&gt;
      </code>
      type trigger errors in Kotlin 2.0.0, thus preventing avoidable compiler errors, crashes, and run-time exceptions later in your code:
     </p>
     <div class="code-block" data-lang="kotlin">
      // Module three
fun test() {
    // Triggers an error in Kotlin 2.0.0, as the type of the implicit 
    // lambda parameter (it) resolves to Node, which is inaccessible
    execute {}

    // Triggers an error in Kotlin 2.0.0, as the type of the unused 
    // lambda parameter (_) resolves to Node, which is inaccessible
    execute { _ -&gt; }

    // Triggers an error in Kotlin 2.0.0, as the type of the unused
    // anonymous function parameter (_) resolves to Node, which is inaccessible
    execute(fun (_) {})
}
     </div>
     <p id="-ynlooc_344">
      In addition to function literals triggering errors when they contain value parameters of inaccessible generic types, errors also occur when a type has an inaccessible generic type argument.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_345">
      For example, you have the same generic class declaration in module one. In module two, you declare another generic class:
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_363">
       Container&lt;C&gt;
      </code>
      . In addition, you declare functions in module two that use
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_364">
       Container&lt;C&gt;
      </code>
      with generic class
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_365">
       Node&lt;V&gt;
      </code>
      as a type argument:

      In future releases we will continue to deprecate the use of inaccessible types in general. We have already started in Kotlin 2.0.0 by adding warnings for some scenarios with inaccessible types, including non-generic ones.

      Consistent resolution order of Kotlin properties and Java fields with the same name

       What's changed?
      </span>
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_388">
      Before Kotlin 2.0.0, if you worked with Java and Kotlin classes that inherited from each other and contained Kotlin properties and Java fields with the same name, the resolution behavior of the duplicated name was inconsistent. There was also conflicting behavior between IntelliJ IDEA and the compiler. When developing the new resolution behavior for Kotlin 2.0.0, we aimed to cause the least impact to users.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_389">
      For example, suppose there is a Java class
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_406">
       Base
      </code>
      :
     </p>
     <div class="code-block" data-lang="java">
      public class Base {
    public String a = "a";

    public String b = "b";
}
     </div>
     <p id="-ynlooc_391">
      Let's say there is also a Kotlin class
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_407">
       Derived
      </code>
      that inherits from the aforementioned
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_408">
       Base
      </code>
      class:
     </p>
     <div class="code-block" data-lang="kotlin">
      class Derived : Base() {
    val a = "aa"

    // Declares custom get() function
    val b get() = "bb"
}

fun main() {
    // Resolves Derived.a
    println(a)
    // aa

    // Resolves Base.b
    println(b)
    // b
}
     </div>
     <p id="-ynlooc_393">
      Prior to Kotlin 2.0.0,
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_409">
       a
      </code>
      resolves to the Kotlin property within the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_410">
       Derived
      </code>
      Kotlin class, whereas
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_411">
       b
      </code>
      resolves to the Java field in the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_412">
       Base
      </code>
      Java class.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_394">
      In Kotlin 2.0.0, the resolution behavior in the example is consistent, ensuring that the Kotlin property supersedes the Java field of the same name. Now,
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_413">
       b
      </code>
      resolves to:
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_414">
       Derived.b
      </code>
      .
     </p>
     <aside class="prompt" data-title="" data-type="tip" id="-ynlooc_395">
      <p id="-ynlooc_415">
       Prior to Kotlin 2.0.0, if you used IntelliJ IDEA to go to the declaration or usage of
       <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_417">
        a
       </code>
       , it would incorrectly navigate to the Java field when it should have navigated to the Kotlin property.
      </p>
      <p id="-ynlooc_416">
       From Kotlin 2.0.0, IntelliJ IDEA correctly navigates to the same location as the compiler.
      </p>
     </aside>
     <p id="-ynlooc_396">
      The general rule is that the subclass takes precedence. The previous example demonstrates this, as the Kotlin property
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_418">
       a
      </code>
      from the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_419">
       Derived
      </code>
      class is resolved because
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_420">
       Derived
      </code>
      is a subclass of the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_421">
       Base
      </code>
      Java class.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_397">
      In the event that the inheritance is reversed and a Java class inherits from a Kotlin class, the Java field in the subclass takes precedence over the Kotlin property with the same name.
     </p>

      Starting with Kotlin 2.0.0, the compiler correctly infers the nullability of Java primitive arrays imported to Kotlin. Now, it retains native nullability from the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_446">
       TYPE_USE
      </code>
      annotations used with Java primitive arrays and emits errors when their values are not used according to annotations.

     <p id="-ynlooc_434">
      Usually, when Java types with
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_447">

      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_448">

      Previously, however, when Java primitive arrays were imported to Kotlin, all
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_449">
       TYPE_USE

      annotations were lost, resulting in platform nullability and possibly unsafe code:

// This might result in a NullPointerException
dataService.fetchData()[0]

      Note that this issue never affected nullability annotations on the declaration itself, only the

       What's changed?

     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_460">
      Due to the separation of common and platform sources during compilation with the K2 compiler, we've implemented stricter rules for abstract members in expected classes.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_461">
      With the previous compiler, it was possible for an expected non-abstract class to inherit an abstract function without
      <a data-tooltip="In Kotlin, implementation inheritance is regulated by the following rule: if a class inherits multiple implementations of the same member from its immediate superclasses, it must override this member and provide its own implementation (perhaps, using one of the inherited ones)." href="inheritance.html#overriding-rules" id="-ynlooc_472">
       overriding the function
      </a>
      . Since the compiler could access both common and platform code at the same time, the compiler could see whether the abstract function had a corresponding override and definition in the actual class.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_462">
      Now that common and platform sources are compiled separately, the inherited function must be explicitly overridden in the expected class so that the compiler knows the function is not abstract. Otherwise, the compiler reports an
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_473">
       ABSTRACT_MEMBER_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
      </code>
      error.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_463">
      For example, let's say you have a common source set where you declare an abstract class called
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_474">
       FileSystem
      </code>
      that has an abstract function
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_475">
       listFiles()
      </code>
      . You define the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_476">
       listFiles()
      </code>
      function in the platform source set as part of an actual declaration.
     </p>
     <p id="-ynlooc_464">
      In your common code, if you have an expected non-abstract class called
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_477">
       PlatformFileSystem
      </code>
      that inherits from the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_478">
       FileSystem
      </code>
      class, the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_479">
       PlatformFileSystem
      </code>
      class inherits the abstract function
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_480">
       listFiles()
      </code>
      . However, you can't have an abstract function in a non-abstract class in Kotlin. To make the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_481">
       listFiles()
      </code>
      function non-abstract, you must declare it as an override without the
      <code class="code" id="-ynlooc_482">
       abstract
      </code>
      keyword:
